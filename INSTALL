----------------------------------------

The compilation system uses a cmake-based cross-platform tool called catkin
See https://wiki.ros.org/catkin

Linux/Mac OSX Instructions:
---------------------------

NOTE from Paul: currently it does *NOT* work with clang, at least not on OSX.
                it seems to be using gcc extensions in the code

This package should be built as any other catkin package.

OpenMP:

cmake will use OpenMP if it exists in your system. Note that OpenMP is
available only on gcc versions >= 4.2. CMake checks this automatically, but you
can force usage or disabling of it by adding "-DUSE_OPENMP=OFF" when manually
running cmake. Use ON to force enabling.

Sometimes siftfast might fail to compile with OpenMP because libgomp.so is not
setup properly to be used by shared objects. In this case, it is necessary to
compile a version of libgomp.

Basically the problem is that the default libgomp might be compiled with
nodlopen flag refusing it to be dynamically loaded. The only way around this is
to compile your own libgomp library and make sure libsiftfast is linking to it.

Matlab:

siftfast.m has been striped away from this package. See the original
library from zerofrog.


Windows Instructions:
